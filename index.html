 <main class="About Me"></main>
 <h2> Wallflower</h2>
 <p> I come from what society would call a "normal family" with my mom and dad, who were married for twenty-six years until my mom sadly passed away four years ago. I am the youngest in the family with an older brother from my dad's previous relationship and an older sister and brother. Growing up in a Christian household, I am grateful for God who has been the center of my existence. It's through faith that I find my identity and purpose. Despite the stereotypes about being the youngest in the family, I admit that some ring true as I've grown older.</p>

 <p> I have always cherished our family travels as they instilled in me a deep love for being family-oriented. Regardless of the destination or activity, it's the togetherness I treasure the most. Yet, behind this seemingly ideal family picture lies a feeling of being overlooked - like a wallflower that is only now starting to bloom. Being the youngest in an uneven family dynamic inevitably led to feelings of being overshadowed by my siblings.My sister had my mom all to herself as the oldest, and it almost seemed as though she had more years with our mom before my brother and I came along. Additionally, her appearance made it easier for others to socialize with her compared to me. In contrast, my brother, as the only boy, had the attention of both my mom and dad. He excelled as the star athlete in our family, garnering praise and admiration from those around us. As an observer, it felt like everyone always talked about him to family, friends, and coworkers, fostering a sense of pride and recognition that I often longed for. I used to strive for perfection to be seen, to be acknowledged for who I truly am, not living under the shadow of others, but struggling with the facade it created. I have discovered different facets of my personality - sometimes outgoing, encouraging, and at other times reserved, guarding myself against potential rejection. However, over the past two years, I've journeyed towards self-acceptance, embracing my true self, and shedding the fear of judgment.</p>

 <p>I am grateful for my life and the experiences that have shaped me, even though I don't always express my gratitude to God as much as I should. Life's challenges and victories are all part of a divine plan to bring glory to His name. My journey is not about me but a testimony of God's character for those who may feel lost, need encouragement, or seek self-acceptance. Every woman has the potential to bloom into who she was created to be, regardless of past circumstances. So, the obstacles I encounter and navigate are not solely for my benefit but also for young girls who may resonate with my struggles, needing reassurance of their worth and purpose. It's also for the perfectionist teenagers yearning for affirmation and those burdened by self-imposed limitations in their twenties. Through my journey of unlearning, self-love, and embracing my identity in God, I strive to show that every woman can blossom into her true self, transcending past and present circumstances. </p>

 <h2>Blomming Wallflower</h2>
 <p>When I want to retreat from the demands of life, I immerse myself in creative pursuits that allow me to let my imagination soar. I find joy in exploring new avenues of expression, whether it's designing graphics for my portfolio, revamping my living space, engaging in a DIY project, curating Pinterest boards for future inspiration, crafting clay earrings, or indulging in a blissful reading session. This retreat into creativity not only rejuvenates me but also ignites a sense of fulfillment and passion within me, reminding me of the youthful Julia who found solace and joy in the simple act of creation. Returning to my inner youth, I fondly reminisce about being teased for devouring one to two chapter books a day. Currently engrossed in "Bridgerton: Romancing Mister Bridgerton," eagerly awaiting the overdue season three centered on Penelope and Colin's story - #TeamPolin. It's no surprise that my instant connection to the Bridgerton series stems from my deep bond with Penelope, resonating with her character on a profound level. As Im currently and always will be in my Bridgerton Era. Also want to apologize Professor EFren as mny work is late because I couldn't put the book down.</p>

<h2>Blossoming Beyond Boundaries</h2>
 <p>Inherently curious and driven by a desire for personal growth, I am constantly seeking knowledge and challenges to become the best version of myself. My interests gravitate towards creative pursuits and social engagement - from exploring branding photography to mastering sign language, deepening my spiritual connection with God, and eagerly volunteering at my church's non-profit organization. This insatiable thirst for expansion not only enriches my life but also fuels my passion for continuous learning and self-improvement.</p>

 <h2>Blossoming Ambitions</h2>
 <p> I believe my purpose in life is to lead people back to God-Whom we were we created for in the first place. God has gives us all different talents and giftings to do help others as while also leading people to Jesus Christ. I see my career goals being used to glorify God by teaching a characteristic of God, which is He's creative because He's the Creator of the things we see and unsee; which means God made us to also be creative because we were made in His Image. Another is bringing the lost and encourage the brokenhearted to come to Jesus because Jesus died so that we can be whole and we can trust Him with our broken pieces because He can take those pieces and always make something beautiful.</p>
